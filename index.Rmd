## Maturity Assessment Reproductive Variability and Life Strategies (MARVLS)

Mission: To advance scientific knowledge and communicate the importance of reproductive biology in the management of marine fish and invertebrates.

MARVLS aspires to integrate reproductive biology into marine resource stock assessment and management by bringing together biologists and stock assessment scientists, to collaboratively advance the knowledge of reproductive information used for setting stock assessment reference points, and to increase understanding of variability in reproductive success due to environmental, biological, and anthropogenic factors.

MARVLS aims to:

- Hold meetings and workshops
- standardize methodology
- share accomplishments and challenges
- provide mentorship
- increase collaboration amongst scientists

## Upcoming MARVLS Events

* **January 17 2:30pm EST - Quarterly Seminar - Reproductive Maturity**

* **May 9-11, 2023 at the Hotel Providence in Providence, Rhode Island 14th National Stock Assessment Workshop**
        
The theme of the workshop is Spatial Modeling.  Approaches for considering the spatial nature of fish populations and fishing vary.  Spatial stock assessments can increase biological realism and reduce bias, though have costs. Thus, the workshop will explore advances in spatial modeling and associated tradeoffs from various perspectives.  As such, presentations are solicited that address spatial modeling applications and case studies, reviews and perspectives, research results, and other forms.               
        
NSAW14 will also include a joint session with the Working Group on Maturity, Assessment, Reproductive Variability, and Life Strategies (MARVLS).  
                
Abstract Submission:  Oral and poster abstracts should be submitted to Abigail Furnish (Abigail.furnish@noaa.gov) no later than Friday, January 20, 2023.  Abstracts should include a short title, list of authors and affiliations, preference for oral or poster presentation, and a description not exceeding 250 words. To help with the NSAW Steering Committeeâ€™s planning, please indicate the pertinent sub-theme ([see Call for Papers](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QvuXZk2C7CR_uVubmQ8IztJq6R8zyDJJ/view?usp=sharing)). 
        
 
Training Opportunities: The Committee also plans to offer optional, free, hands-on trainings on the afternoon of Monday, May 8th.  The specific topics are still being discussed, but keep an eye out for more information
