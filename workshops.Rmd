## 2024

The NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center hosted the 5th biennial meeting for the Maturity Assessment Reproductive Variability and Life Strategies (MARVLS) working group in conjunction with the [National Meeting of the American Fisheries Society in Honolulu in September 14 - 20, 2024](https://afsannualmeeting.fisheries.org/).

Workshop Events

* Saturday September 14: Cultural site visit to Hawaiian Fish Pond - Paepae O He'eia.

* Sunday September 15: MARVLS histology workshop and AFS Continuing education course “Interpreting Reproductive Histology: Female Maturity and Reproductive Phases” led by Nancy Brown-Peterson and Hayden Menendez from 1-5pm at the Honolulu Convention Center.  This was a more formal version of a gonad histology workshop, and Nancy and Hayden reached out for materials from other scientists working on fishes outside the southeast US region. Their presentation assembled these diverse descriptions and showed where and how much it matters when calculating point estimates of size and age at maturity.  Workshop presentation and materials are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wVYM5Hk6_CK8vn4Gx2egGTXzDEGEs-ez).

* Tuesday September 17 - Thursday 19: AFS conference at the Honolulu Convention Center. 

* Wednesday September 18: Honolulu Fish Auction
As the sun rose, Russ Ito (PIFSC) got us oriented to local, federal fisheries, particularly the large pelagics of the Pacific. He shared his experience and knowledge as we walked into the fish auction. The buyers, sellers, and dockworkers performed choreographed movements around large pallets of fish.
